#  Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python projects that helped me build and strengthen my core programming skills. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates concepts like user input, file handling, web requests, and basic logic building.

##  Projects Included

###  Number Guesser Game
A simple terminal-based guessing game where the computer picks a random number and the user tries to guess it. The program provides hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" until the correct answer is guessed.

###  Password Generator
Generates strong and random passwords based on the selected complexity. Users can choose the length and whether to include letters, digits, and special characters.

###  To-Do List App
A command-line to-do list manager where users can add, view, mark complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved to a file for persistence across sessions.

###  PDF Merger
A handy script to merge multiple PDF files into one combined file. Great for managing documents efficiently without manual effort. Built using `PyPDF2`.

###  Weather App
Displays real-time weather data (temperature, condition, humidity) for any city entered by the user. Uses data from OpenWeatherMap API and demonstrates how to parse JSON responses in Python.
